## Avengers!!! Assemble...

Welcome to **Avengers Assemble**, a turn‑based puzzle game set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Select your favorite Avenger, outsmart Hawkeye (just like Black Widow did in the movie) and avoid picking up the last block, forcing Hawkeye to retrive the Soul Stone.

### 🎮 Game Overview

In **Avengers Assemble**, you and an AI‑controlled Hawkeye take turns removing blocks from a stack of pillars.

The twist? If Hawkeye is forced to take the final block, YOU WIN! Hawkeye retrives the Soul Stone and the main MCU Timeline remains untampered. This allows the main timeline to go as shown in the movie - "Avengers Endgame" - where the Avengers sucessfully stop Thanos.

However, if Hawkeye isn't the last one to take the final block, this changes the entire timeline as a new branch grows off when you grab the soul stone instead. As mentioned by Dr. Strange, there is only "ONE" possibility out of "14,000,605" that leads to Avengers stopping Thanos. Thus, the TVA appears to prunes you! Or shall I say - "Ah, the TVA in all its bureaucratic glory has graciously chosen to prune you with your own… ‘defeat.’ How utterly delightful.” (Loki - God of Time + God of Mischief)

Each match features:

* **Randomly determined turns**: Who starts each game? The choice is up to chance. ⚖️
* **Varied pillar configurations**: Every level has different number of blocks per pillar, keeping strategy fresh.
* **Dynamic difficulty**: Choose from *Easy*, *Medium*, or *Hard* — Hawkeye (AI) will adapt and become savvier as you climb the difficulty ladder.
